= Terraform Provider for Uptime.com

== Requirements

* Terraform v0.12.0 or higher
* Go v1.12 or higher (https://go.dev/doc/install[installation instructions])

== Installation

=== Download &amp; build the provider

First, download and build the provider on your local machine:

----
git clone https://github.com/uptime-com/terraform-provider-uptime.git
cd terraform-provider-uptime
go build -o ~/go/bin/terraform-provider-uptime
----

=== Installing

In order for Terraform to use terraform-provider-uptime, it needs to be linked to the plugin directory. Example commands for an OS X Darwin machine:

----
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/darwin_amd64
ln -s ~/go/bin/terraform-provider-uptime ~/.terraform.d/plugins/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-uptime
----

For Linux machines, follow the OS X process, replacing `darwin` with `linux`.

For a Windows machine, in PowerShell:

[source,powershell]
----
New-Item %APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins\windows_amd64 -Type 'directory' -Force
cmd /c mklink /d $env:GOPATH\bin\terraform-provider-uptime %APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins\windows_amd64\terraform-provider-uptime
----

=== Rate Limits

Terraform has a tendency to use many API requests when managing a large group of Uptime.com checks. If this becomes a problem, please contact Uptime.com support to request a rate limit increase.
