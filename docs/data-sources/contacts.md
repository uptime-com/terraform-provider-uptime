locals {
  production_contacts = [
    for contact in data.uptime_contacts.all.contacts :
    contact if can(regex("production", lower(contact.name)))
  ]
}

# Use a contact in a check configuration
resource "uptime_check_http" "api" {
  name    = "API Health Check"
  address = "https://api.example.com/health"
