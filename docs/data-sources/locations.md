data "uptime_locations" "all" {}

# Output all available locations
output "all_locations" {
  value       = data.uptime_locations.all.locations
  description = "All available monitoring locations"
}

# Filter for US locations only
locals {
  us_locations = [
    for loc in data.uptime_locations.all.locations :
    loc.name if can(regex("^US", loc.name))
  ]
}

output "us_locations" {
  value       = local.us_locations
  description = "US-based monitoring locations"
}

# Filter for European locations

  ]
}

output "eu_locations" {
  value       = local.eu_locations
