## Schema

### Required

- `address` (String) A valid URL with a required scheme (e.g., 'https://example.com', 'http://192.168.1.1:8080').
Must include protocol scheme and valid hostname or IP address. Port numbers are optional.
- `name` (String)

### Optional

- `contact_groups` (Set of String) List of contact group names to receive notifications. 
Each contact group can contain multiple contacts (email addresses, phone numbers, or integrations) 
that will be notified when alerts are triggered. Defaults to ['Default'] if not specified.
- `encryption` (String) Whether to verify SSL/TLS certificates
- `expect_string` (String)
- `expect_string_type` (String) Valid values for this property are: "STRING" - exact match, "REGEX" - match by regular expression, "INVERSE_REGEX" - fail if the regular expression matches
- `headers` (Map of List of String) A map of HTTP headers where each header name maps to a list of values. 
Header names are case-insensitive. Multiple values for the same header are supported 
(e.g., { 'Accept': ['application/json', 'text/plain'] }). Defaults to an empty map if not specified.
- `include_in_global_metrics` (Boolean) Include this check in uptime/response time calculations for the dashboard and status pages
- `interval` (Number) The interval between checks in minutes
- `is_paused` (Boolean)
- `locations` (Set of String)
- `notes` (String)
- `num_retries` (Number) How many times the check should be retried before a location is considered down
- `password` (String, Sensitive)
- `port` (Number) The `Port` value is mandatory if the address URL contains a custom, non-standard port. It should be set to the same value.
- `proxy` (String)
- `send_string` (String) String to post

- `sla` (Attributes) SLA related attributes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sla))
- `status_code` (String)
- `tags` (Set of String) List of tags to organize and filter monitoring checks. 
Each account can have up to 3,000 unique tags, with a 100-character limit per tag. 
Tags help categorize resources for filtering in Dashboards, Public Status Pages, and SLA Reports. 
Common use cases include tagging by team ('dev-team', 'ops'), environment ('production', 'staging'), 
or purpose ('api', 'customer-facing'). Defaults to an empty list if not specified.
- `threshold` (Number) A timeout alert will be issued if the check takes longer than this many seconds to complete
- `username` (String)
- `version` (Number) Check version to use. Keep default value unless you are absolutely sure you need to change it

- `id` (Number) The ID of this resource.
- `url` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--sla"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sla`

Optional:

- `latency` (String) The maximum average response time. Unit is mandatory (e.g. 1500ms or 1.5s or 1s500ms).
- `uptime` (String) The minimum uptime percentage. \nMust be a fraction with exactly 4 decimal places (e.g. 0.9995 for 99.95% uptime)
