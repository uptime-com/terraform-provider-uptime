# uptime_check_pop (Resource)

Monitor POP server availability. Import using the check ID: `terraform import uptime_check_pop.example 123`

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic POP3 check
resource "uptime_check_pop" "example" {
  name    = "POP3 Server Check"
  address = "mail.example.com"
}

# POP3 check with custom port
resource "uptime_check_pop" "custom_port" {
  name    = "POP3 Custom Port"
  address = "mail.example.com"
  port    = 995
}

# POP3 check with encryption
resource "uptime_check_pop" "secure" {
  name       = "Secure POP3"
  address    = "mail.example.com"
  port       = 995
  encryption = "SSL_TLS"
}

# POP3 check with full configuration
resource "uptime_check_pop" "full" {
  name           = "Production POP3"
  address        = "pop.example.com"
  port           = 995
  encryption     = "SSL_TLS"
  interval       = 5
  contact_groups = ["nobody"]
  num_retries    = 2
}

## Schema

### Required

- `address` (String) A valid DNS hostname (e.g., 'example.com', 'sub.example.com'). 
Must start and end with alphanumeric characters, can contain hyphens but not at the start or end, 
and must have at least one dot separator between valid DNS labels.
- `name` (String)

### Optional

- `contact_groups` (Set of String) List of contact group names to receive notifications.
Each contact group can contain multiple contacts (email addresses, phone numbers, or integrations)
that will be notified when alerts are triggered. Defaults to ['Default'] if not specified.
Set to an empty list to disable notifications at this level and rely on parent check group notifications instead.
- `encryption` (String) Whether to use TLS
- `expect_string` (String) String to expect in server response (may be repeated)
- `include_in_global_metrics` (Boolean) Include this check in uptime/response time calculations for the dashboard and status pages
- `interval` (Number) The interval between checks in minutes
- `is_paused` (Boolean)
- `locations` (Set of String)
- `notes` (String)
- `num_retries` (Number) How many times the check should be retried before a location is considered down
- `port` (Number) The port to check
- `sla` (Attributes) SLA related attributes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sla))
- `tags` (Set of String) List of tags to organize and filter monitoring checks. 
Each account can have up to 3,000 unique tags, with a 100-character limit per tag. 
Tags help categorize resources for filtering in Dashboards, Public Status Pages, and SLA Reports. 
Common use cases include tagging by team ('dev-team', 'ops'), environment ('production', 'staging'), 
or purpose ('api', 'customer-facing'). Defaults to an empty list if not specified.
- `use_ip_version` (String) Whether to use IPv4 or IPv6 for the check.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of this resource.
- `url` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--sla"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sla`

Optional:

- `latency` (String) The maximum average response time. Unit is mandatory (e.g. 1500ms or 1.5s or 1s500ms).
- `uptime` (String) The minimum uptime percentage. \nMust be a fraction with exactly 4 decimal places (e.g. 0.9995 for 99.95% uptime)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import using the check ID
terraform import uptime_check_pop.example 123
```
