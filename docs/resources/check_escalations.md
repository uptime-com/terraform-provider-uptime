# uptime_check_escalations (Resource)

Manages escalation rules for a check. Escalations allow you to configure
multiple levels of notifications that are triggered after specific wait times when a check is down.
Each escalation level can send alerts to different contact groups and be repeated multiple times.

Note: This resource manages the escalation configuration for an existing check.
The check must be created first using one of the uptime_check_* resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an HTTP check
resource "uptime_check_http" "website" {
  name    = "Website Health Check"
  address = "https://example.com"
}

# Configure escalation rules for the check
resource "uptime_check_escalations" "website" {
  check_id = uptime_check_http.website.id

  escalations = [
    {
      # First escalation: wait 5 minutes, notify Default group 3 times
      wait_time      = 300
      num_repeats    = 3
      contact_groups = ["Default"]
    },
    {
      # Second escalation: wait 10 more minutes, notify On-Call team indefinitely
      wait_time      = 600
      num_repeats    = 0 # 0 means repeat indefinitely
      contact_groups = ["On-Call Team"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `check_id` (Number) The ID of the check to configure escalations for
- `escalations` (Attributes List) List of escalation rules. Each escalation is triggered sequentially
after the specified wait time. If the list is empty, all escalations will be removed from the check. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--escalations))

<a id="nestedatt--escalations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `escalations`

Required:

- `contact_groups` (Set of String) List of contact group names to receive notifications for this escalation level.
Each contact group can contain multiple contacts (email addresses, phone numbers, or integrations).
- `num_repeats` (Number) Number of times to repeat this escalation level.
Use 0 to repeat indefinitely until the check recovers.
- `wait_time` (Number) Time to wait (in seconds) before triggering this escalation level.
For the first escalation, this is the time after the initial alert. For subsequent escalations,
this is the time after the previous escalation.
