Verify SSL certificate validity



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `address` (String) A valid DNS hostname (e.g., 'example.com', 'sub.example.com'). 
Must start and end with alphanumeric characters, can contain hyphens but not at the start or end, 
and must have at least one dot separator between valid DNS labels.
- `name` (String)

### Optional

- `config` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `contact_groups` (Set of String) List of contact group names to receive notifications.
Each contact group can contain multiple contacts (email addresses, phone numbers, or integrations)
that will be notified when alerts are triggered. Defaults to ['Default'] if not specified.
Set to an empty list to disable notifications at this level and rely on parent check group notifications instead.
- `is_paused` (Boolean)
- `notes` (String)
- `num_retries` (Number) How many times the check should be retried before a location is considered down
- `port` (Number) The port to check
- `tags` (Set of String) List of tags to organize and filter monitoring checks. 
Each account can have up to 3,000 unique tags, with a 100-character limit per tag. 
Tags help categorize resources for filtering in Dashboards, Public Status Pages, and SLA Reports. 
Common use cases include tagging by team ('dev-team', 'ops'), environment ('production', 'staging'), 
or purpose ('api', 'customer-facing'). Defaults to an empty list if not specified.
- `threshold` (Number) Raise an alert if there are less than this many days before the SSL certificate needs to be renewed

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of this resource.
- `locations` (Set of String)
- `url` (String)

### Nested Schema for `config`

Optional:

- `crl` (Boolean)
- `fingerprint` (String)
- `first_element_only` (Boolean)
- `ignore_authority_warnings` (Boolean) Ignore certificate authority warnings
- `ignore_sct` (Boolean) Ignore signed certificate timestamp (SCT) validation
- `issuer` (String)
- `match` (String)
- `min_version` (String)
- `protocol` (String) Application level protocol
- `resolve` (String) Force host IP address resolution. Format: hostname:port:ip_address (e.g., example.com:443:1.2.3.4)
- `self_signed` (Boolean)
- `url` (String) Specify location of certificate or CRL file by URL, instead of retrieving from main domain address.
