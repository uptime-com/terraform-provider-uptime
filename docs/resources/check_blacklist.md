```terraform
# Basic blacklist check (email/IP reputation)
resource "uptime_check_blacklist" "example" {
  name    = "IP Blacklist Check"
  address = "mail.example.com"
}

# Blacklist check for mail server
resource "uptime_check_blacklist" "mail" {
  name    = "Mail Server Reputation"
  address = "smtp.example.com"
}

# Blacklist check with full configuration
resource "uptime_check_blacklist" "full" {
  name           = "Production Mail Reputation"
  address        = "mail.example.com"

## Schema

### Required

- `address` (String) Domain name to check
- `name` (String)

### Optional

- `contact_groups` (Set of String) List of contact group names to receive notifications.
Each contact group can contain multiple contacts (email addresses, phone numbers, or integrations)
that will be notified when alerts are triggered. Defaults to ['Default'] if not specified.
Set to an empty list to disable notifications at this level and rely on parent check group notifications instead.
- `is_paused` (Boolean)
- `notes` (String)
- `num_retries` (Number) How many times the check should be retried before a location is considered down
- `tags` (Set of String) List of tags to organize and filter monitoring checks. 
Each account can have up to 3,000 unique tags, with a 100-character limit per tag. 
Tags help categorize resources for filtering in Dashboards, Public Status Pages, and SLA Reports. 
Common use cases include tagging by team ('dev-team', 'ops'), environment ('production', 'staging'), 
or purpose ('api', 'customer-facing'). Defaults to an empty list if not specified.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of this resource.
- `locations` (Set of String)
- `url` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import using the check ID
terraform import uptime_check_blacklist.example 123
```
