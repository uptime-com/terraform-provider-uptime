# uptime_service_variable (Resource)

Links a credential property to a check/service, allowing secure injection of sensitive values into check configurations.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a basic auth credential
resource "uptime_credential" "api_auth" {
  display_name    = "API Basic Auth"
  credential_type = "BASIC"
  username        = "admin"
  secret = {
    password = "secret-password"
  }
}

# Create an HTTP check
resource "uptime_check_http" "api" {
  name    = "API Health Check"
  address = "https://api.example.com/health"
  # ... other configuration ...
}

# Link the password to the check as a variable
resource "uptime_service_variable" "api_password" {
  service_id    = uptime_check_http.api.id
  credential_id = uptime_credential.api_auth.id
  variable_name = "auth_password"
  property_name = "password"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `credential_id` (Number) The ID of the credential containing the sensitive value to inject
- `property_name` (String) The property name from the credential to use. Valid values depend on credential_type: 'password' for BASIC, 'secret' for TOKEN, 'certificate'/'key'/'passphrase' for CERTIFICATE
- `service_id` (Number) The ID of the check/service this variable belongs to. Changing this forces recreation of the resource.
- `variable_name` (String) The name of the variable as referenced in the check configuration

### Read-Only

- `account` (String) Account identifier (computed)
- `id` (Number) The ID of this resource.
- `service` (String) Service identifier (computed)
