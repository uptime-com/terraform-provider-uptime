# uptime_check_group (Resource)

Combine multiple checks. Import using the check ID: `terraform import uptime_check_group.example 123`

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic check group
resource "uptime_check_group" "example" {
  name   = "Production Services"
  config = {}
}

# Check group with down condition and contacts
resource "uptime_check_group" "with_condition" {
  name = "API Services"
  config = {
    down_condition = "TWO"
  }
  contact_groups = ["nobody"]
}

# Check group with AVERAGE uptime calculation
# Note: AVERAGE mode cannot have contact groups assigned
# resource "uptime_check_group" "with_calculation" {
#   name = "Critical Infrastructure"
#   config = {
#     uptime_percent_calculation = "AVERAGE"
#   }
# }

# Using check group with HTTP checks (recommended pattern)
# Reference check names from created resources
# Note: services can reference checks by name or ID
# resource "uptime_check_http" "api" {
#   name    = "API Health"
#   address = "https://api.example.com/health"
# }
#
# resource "uptime_check_http" "web" {
#   name    = "Web Frontend"
#   address = "https://www.example.com"
# }
#
# resource "uptime_check_group" "combined" {
#   depends_on = [uptime_check_http.api, uptime_check_http.web]
#   name       = "Web Application"
#   config = {
#     services       = [uptime_check_http.api.name, uptime_check_http.web.name]
#     down_condition = "ALL"
#   }
#   contact_groups = ["nobody"]
# }
```

## Schema

### Required

- `config` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `name` (String)

### Optional

- `contact_groups` (Set of String) List of contact group names to receive notifications.
Each contact group can contain multiple contacts (email addresses, phone numbers, or integrations)
that will be notified when alerts are triggered. Defaults to ['Default'] if not specified.
Set to an empty list to disable notifications at this level and rely on parent check group notifications instead.
- `include_in_global_metrics` (Boolean) Include this check in uptime/response time calculations for the dashboard and status pages
- `is_paused` (Boolean)
- `notes` (String)
- `sla` (Attributes) SLA related attributes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sla))
- `tags` (Set of String) List of tags to organize and filter monitoring checks. 
Each account can have up to 3,000 unique tags, with a 100-character limit per tag. 
Tags help categorize resources for filtering in Dashboards, Public Status Pages, and SLA Reports. 
Common use cases include tagging by team ('dev-team', 'ops'), environment ('production', 'staging'), 
or purpose ('api', 'customer-facing'). Defaults to an empty list if not specified.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config`

Optional:

- `down_condition` (String) Condition that determines when the group check is considered DOWN. Valid values: `ANY`, `TWO`, `THREE`, `FOUR`, `FIVE`, `TEN`, `ONE_PCT`, `THREE_PCT`, `FIVE_PCT`, `TEN_PCT`, `TWENTYFIVE_PCT`, `FIFTY_PCT`, `ALL`. Numeric values (TWO-TEN) mean the group is DOWN when that many checks are down. Percentage values (ONE_PCT-FIFTY_PCT) mean the group is DOWN when that percentage of checks are down. Defaults to `ANY`.
- `response_time` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--response_time))
- `services` (Set of String) List of check IDs to be included in the group (specified as strings, e.g., ["5581024"]).
A group can contain up to 200 individual checks of any type (except other group checks).
Checks can be part of multiple groups simultaneously. Defaults to an empty list if not specified.
- `tags` (Set of String) List of tags to organize and filter monitoring checks. 
Each account can have up to 3,000 unique tags, with a 100-character limit per tag. 
Tags help categorize resources for filtering in Dashboards, Public Status Pages, and SLA Reports. 
Common use cases include tagging by team ('dev-team', 'ops'), environment ('production', 'staging'), 
or purpose ('api', 'customer-facing'). Defaults to an empty list if not specified.
- `uptime_percent_calculation` (String) Method used to calculate the group's uptime percentage. Valid values: `UP_DOWN_STATES` (calculates based on up/down state transitions), `AVERAGE` (calculates as the average uptime of all included checks). Defaults to `UP_DOWN_STATES`.

### Nested Schema for `config.response_time`

Optional:

- `calculation_mode` (String)
- `check_type` (String)
- `single_check` (String)



<a id="nestedatt--sla"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sla`

Optional:

- `latency` (String) The maximum average response time. Unit is mandatory (e.g. 1500ms or 1.5s or 1s500ms).
- `uptime` (String) The minimum uptime percentage. \nMust be a fraction with exactly 4 decimal places (e.g. 0.9995 for 99.95% uptime)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import using the check group ID
terraform import uptime_check_group.example 123
```
