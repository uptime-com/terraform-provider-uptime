    uptime = {
      source  = "uptime-com/uptime"

}

variable "uptime_token" {
  type = string
}

provider "uptime" {
  token = var.uptime_token
}

data uptime_locations all {}

resource random_integer location {
  min = 3
  max = length(data.uptime_locations.all.locations) - 1

## Schema

### Optional

- `endpoint` (String)
- `rate_limit` (Number) The rate limit to use for API calls in requests per second, defaults to 0.5
- `token` (String, Sensitive)

## Rate Limits

Terraform has a tendency to use many API requests when managing a large group of Uptime.com checks.
If this becomes a problem, please contact Uptime.com support to request a rate limit increase.
